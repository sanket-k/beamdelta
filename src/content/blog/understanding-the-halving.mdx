Every four years, something remarkable happens in the Bitcoin network: the **halving**. This programmed event cuts the rate at which new bitcoins are created in half, making it one of the most significant events in the cryptocurrency calendar.

## What Is the Halving?

The Bitcoin halving (sometimes called "halvening") is a scheduled reduction in the block reward—the number of new bitcoins miners receive for adding a new block to the blockchain. This happens approximately every **210,000 blocks**, or roughly every 4 years.

<Callout type="info" title="The Numbers">
  When Bitcoin launched in 2009, miners received **50 BTC** per block. After four halvings, the current reward is just **3.125 BTC** per block.

### Historical Halvings

| Halving | Date | Block Height | Block Reward |
|---------|------|--------------|--------------|
| Genesis | Jan 2009 | 0 | 50 BTC |
| 1st | Nov 2012 | 210,000 | 25 BTC |
| 2nd | Jul 2016 | 420,000 | 12.5 BTC |
| 3rd | May 2020 | 630,000 | 6.25 BTC |
| 4th | Apr 2024 | 840,000 | 3.125 BTC |

## Why Does the Halving Matter?

The halving is central to Bitcoin's value proposition as "digital gold." Here's why:

### 1. Controlled Supply

Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed indefinitely, Bitcoin has a **hard cap of 21 million coins**. The halving ensures this supply is released gradually over ~140 years, with the last bitcoin expected to be mined around 2140.

### 2. Decreasing Inflation

Each halving dramatically reduces Bitcoin's inflation rate. Watch how the inflation rate drops at each halving event in the simulation below:

<MiniSim 
  type="bitcoin-inflation" 
  title="Bitcoin Inflation Over Time"
  config={{ blockReward: 50, halvingInterval: 210000, maxBlocks: 2100000 }}
/>

Try adjusting the **block reward** slider to see how different initial rewards would have affected Bitcoin's inflation curve.

### 3. Stock-to-Flow Dynamics

The halving affects Bitcoin's **stock-to-flow ratio**—a metric that compares existing supply (stock) to new production (flow). After each halving, this ratio doubles, theoretically increasing scarcity.

  Open the [full simulation](/sims/bitcoin/inflation) to experiment with different halving intervals and block rewards. What happens if halvings occurred every 100,000 blocks instead of 210,000?

## The Math Behind the Halving

The block reward at any given block height `h` follows this formula:

```
reward(h) = initial_reward / 2^(floor(h / halving_interval))
```

For Bitcoin's parameters:
- **Initial reward**: 50 BTC
- **Halving interval**: 210,000 blocks

At block 840,000 (the 4th halving):
```
reward(840000) = 50 / 2^(floor(840000 / 210000))
               = 50 / 2^4
               = 50 / 16
               = 3.125 BTC
```

## Common Misconceptions

<Callout type="warning" title="Myth Busting">
  **"The halving will crash Bitcoin's price"** — While miner economics change, historical data shows halvings have typically preceded bull markets, not crashes.
</Callout>

### Does the Halving Affect Transaction Fees?

Not directly. Transaction fees are determined by network demand, not the block reward. However, as block rewards diminish, fees are expected to become a larger portion of miner revenue.

### When Will All Bitcoins Be Mined?

The last bitcoin will be mined around the year **2140**. After this, miners will rely entirely on transaction fees for revenue.

## What's Next?

The 5th halving is expected in **2028**, reducing the block reward to just **1.5625 BTC**. By then, over 99% of all bitcoins will have already been mined.

Understanding the halving is fundamental to understanding Bitcoin's monetary policy. Unlike central banks that make discretionary decisions about money supply, Bitcoin's issuance schedule is:

- **Predetermined** — known in advance
- **Immutable** — cannot be changed
- **Verifiable** — visible on the blockchain

This transparency and predictability is what makes Bitcoin unique among monetary systems.
